This code is made in for the DDD personal portfolio, It contains a login system as well as the ability for a personal supervisor and student to book meetings and allow a student to submit details.

For the ease of use and testing, I have created a some Login Details which allow you to see the range of usability for each of the users as well as get the best overview of the project

For an easy view of student and how to interact - Enter a as the username and A as the password.

For an easy view of Personal Supervisor and how to interact - Enter b as the username and B as the password.

For an easy view of Senior Tutor  - Enter c as the username and C as the password.

To view the difference in handeling of the students with/without a booked meeting, - enter DavidWebb as the Username and David as the password.

This is a console application which allows the user to sign in.

There is a built in database preloaded with test data.
